Swipe BeaconSender
============
This app is part of an iBeacon demonstration of Swipe.

It will act as an iBeacon on any capable iOS 7 device (iPhone 4S and later, iPad 3 and later, iPod touch 5th gen and later).

The other part consists of the [Receiver app, also available in the Swipe Github account](https://github.com/swipestudio/BeaconReceiver).

Please make sure to change the variable _uuidString to your own unique UUID (you can generate one using ´uuidgen´ in OS X Terminal) in the SBSViewController.

Usage
====
For usage instructions, see the description of the [Receiver app](https://github.com/swipestudio/BeaconReceiver).
